# MIDI Player (Bookmarklet MOD for Multiplayer Piano)

### How to use

1. Copy the code from this file:
   - [MIDI-Player.js.bookmarklet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Andrew-J-Larson/Custom-JS/main/Any/!-Bookmarklets/Multiplayer%20Piano/MIDI-Player/MIDI-Player.js.bookmarklet)
2. Create a new bookmark, name it `MIDI Player (load mod)` or something that you can easily identify, and paste in the code where the URL would be.
3. After saving the bookmark, click on it on any Multiplayer Piano website to activate.

You'll know it worked if you can see the `MIDI Player` button with the other buttons.

### Want it auto activate? Use the User-Script instead!

Location of the User-Script (`MIDI-Player.user.js`) is at:
