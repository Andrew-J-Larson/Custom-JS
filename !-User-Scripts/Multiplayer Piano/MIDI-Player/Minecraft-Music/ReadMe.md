# Minecraft Music Auto Player (MOD for Multiplayer Piano)

### How to use
1. Install a user script extension such as Tampermonkey.
2. Load the [Auto-Player.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheAlienDrew/Custom-JS/main/!-User-Scripts/Multiplayer%20Piano/MIDI-Player/Minecraft-Music/Auto-Player.user.js) file in.
3. Reload the Multiplayer Piano (or clone) website.

You'll know it worked if you can run the `/about` command on it.

## NOTE

Minecraft MIDI file data not included in the script, you must convert your own midi files to data URI's yourself, and add them to respective locations in the source code.
