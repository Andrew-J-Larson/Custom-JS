# MIDI Player (MOD for Multiplayer Piano)

### How to use
1. Install a user script extension such as Tampermonkey.
2. Load the [MIDI-Player.user.js](https://github.com/TheAlienDrew/Custom-JS/blob/master/!-User-Scripts/Multiplayer%20Piano/MIDI-Player/MIDI-Player.user.js) file in.
3. Reload the Multiplayer Piano (or clone) website.

You'll know it worked if you can see the `MIDI Player` button with the other buttons.

### Don't want to use the user script?

Location of the pure javascript (`MIDI-Playerloader.js` or `MIDI-Player.js`) is at:
