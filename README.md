# Tampermonkey Scripts
Useful injected javascripts for certain websites.

For any folder, it starts off with the website a script can be used on, and inside of each folder will be either scripts or more folders that pertain to specific function on the website.

For a script that works on all websites (or filters itself based on mulitple websites), they'll most likely reside in the "Any" folder, such as a programatically set CSS.
